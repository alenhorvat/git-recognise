## Introduction

Projects are powered by individuals, and fostering an environment of open and transparent recognition of contributions and skills is crucial for the professional development of these individuals.

The **git recognise** initiative offers a straightforward and transparent mechanism for projects to acknowledge the specific contributions made by individuals and the valuable skills they bring to the project. These acknowledgments and recognitions are not limited to those creating commits within a particular repository; they can extend to anyone contributing to the projects.

While our model may not be as comprehensive as end-to-end verifiable frameworks, we firmly believe that this simplified approach can significantly benefit individuals in their career paths. It achieves this by providing everyone with the opportunity to receive recognition and acknowledgment for their skills, all backed by a verifiable historical record using **git repositories**.

## Features

- **Contribution Templates**: We are presenting a simple contributions template, streamlining the process of acknowledging contributions in a machine-readable format. See the [Contribution Templates - Explained](#contributions-template-explained) section for more details. The template is evolving and we're inviting domain experts to contribute.

- **Verifiable Profile**: Wa are introducing a simple verifiable profile template repository everyone can fork and set up within minutes. The repository contains your profile information and is used to elevate your professional profile by showcasing your contributions via git recognise. See the [Portfolio Template - Explained](#portfolio-template-explained) section for more details. The template is evolving and we're inviting domain experts to contribute.

- **Portfolio Viewer**: An online viewer that enables to view and check your portfolio and contributions. (coming soon)

2. Add contributors and their roles/skills to the file according to the template.

3. Notify your users that you're using git-recognise

## How can I, as a project contributor, showcase my contributions and skills?

Begin showcasing your contributions in three simple steps:

1. Clone the **verifiable-profile** repository (ensure it's public).

2. Edit the **profile.yaml** by filling in your profile information and adding project repositories where you've contributed.
