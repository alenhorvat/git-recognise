## Introduction

Projects are powered by people, and fostering an environment of transparent and verifiable endorsement of skills and contributions is fundamental for the professional development of all contributors.

The fundamental concept revolves around utilizing Git to acknowledge and endorse contributors' skills, which are showcased through their contributions.

**git recognise** introduces a straightforward and transparent mechanism for projects to acknowledge the specific contributions made by all contributors, not only those who push the code, and the valuable skills contributors bring to the project.

## How do I start?

### Are you a project owner? Recognise and acknowledge contributions and skills

Start recognizing project contributions today in three simple steps:

1. Copy the [contributions.yaml](contributions.yaml) to your project's repository (root folder). See the [contributions definition](schemas/contributions/README.md) for more information about the structure and supported claims.

2. Add contributors and their roles/skills to the file according to the template.

3. Notify your users that you're using git-recognise

### Are you a contributor? Showcase your contributions and skills

Showcase your contributions in three simple steps:

- Fork the [Verifiable Profile Repository](https://github.com/skilljot/verifiable-profile-template)
  - Visit the repository
  - Click on the "Use this template" button on the top-right
    - Enter a name for your new repository. Repository name MUST be verifiable-profile
    - Click on "Create repository from template".
- Edit the **profile.yaml** by filling in your profile information and adding project repositories where you've contributed.
- Commit and push the changes to your repository.

Every time your project is using git-recognise, add the project to **profile.yaml**.

### Are you a contributor or verifier? Check out the Verifiable Portfolio

Visit [SkillJot](https://www.skilljot.com) and enter your or user's GitHub handler. If user's projects are leveraging the power of git-recognise, you'll see it in the profile.
